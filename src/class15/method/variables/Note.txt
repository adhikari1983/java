Methods:
    In Java, a method is a block of code or a collection of statements that
    perform a specific task. It is designed to perform a particular function or
    piece of logic within a program. We can create a method and then call it
    multiple times from different parts of the program rather than repeating the
    same block of code in multiple places.

    WHY WE SHOULD USE METHODS ?
        1) Code re-usability
        2) Organize the code
        3) changing code becomes easier.

how to create method in java?
    1. Name of the method with/without  A. -> (types of access modifier) = public, private, protected, default
                                        B. -> static

    2. Methods in java,  have return types(output of a method).
      e.g. -> void,String int char etc.

    3. They can also take parameters(input).
      e.g. -> parameters can of primitive or/and non-primitive.

    4. The body of the method can contain any logic.
       e.g. -> like arrays, loops , if conditions, switch.

=====================================================================

Types of variables w.r.t scope(coverage, reach,the visibility and accessibility)
    There are 3-types of variables with respect to scope. local, instance and
    static variables.

1. Local variables:
    Local variables are created inside the block of codes they can only be accessed only within that block.
    e.g. all the variables that we create inside
       -> methods, if statements, switch case statements, loops etc.
Upside:
    1) Local variables stay shorter in the memory, the moment that block
       of code is done executing, memory is freed and is available to
       be re-used.
    2) We can re-use the same name for other variables in other blocks of code.
Downside:
    1) They have limited visibility. They can't be used outside the block other than in which
    they are created.
    2) Initialization is mandatory for local variables, and failure to do so
    results in a compilation error.

2. Instance variables:
    Instance variables are created inside a class, but outside of any block of code like method,
    loop,if statement etc.
Upside:
    1) Instance variables can be used without initializing.
    2) Instance variables can be shared between all instance methods of a class.
Downside:
    1)They tend to occupy the memory for longer as compared to local variables.
    2) They are hard to debug.

3. Static variables:
    All the instance variables with static keyword are called static variables.
Upside:
    1) They can be shared across all the instances of static methods and
    the instances of a class.
    2) Only one memory location is reserved for static variables even though we
    create 1 million objects of that class.
downSide:
    1) They code can be hard to debug if we don't use the final keyword.
    2) If value is changed anywhere in the code that gets changed for the complete
    application.


when we should use local variables ?
    Always when ever possible.

when we should use instance variables ?
    1) If we have to share something in more than 1 instance methods.
    2) When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and these objects
    can have different values for different objects we should go with instance variables.

when we should use static variables ?
    1) when we want to share something globally in all the classes, methods, and  blocks of code.
    2) Mostly used to create constants like no of months, no of days, value of PI, value of Gravity etc.
