Methods/functions/behaviours:
    Method is c block of code. when we call the method all the logic is executed that
    is present inside the method. Method can also take parameters which is the
    data that we can pass when we call these methods.


Why we should learn about methods:
    1) Code re-usability
    2) Organize the code
    3) changing code becomes easier.

Syntax
    access-modifier return-type method-name(parameter-list) {
        // method body
    }
Access Modifier: The access modifier determines the accessibility of the method.
                 Java has four access modifiers: public, protected, private, and default (no access modifier specified).

Return Type: The return type specifies the data type of the value that the method returns.
             If the method does not return a value, its return type is void.

Method Name: The method name is an identifier that is used to call the method.
             It should be a meaningful name that describes the purpose of the method.

Parameter List: The parameter list specifies the data type and name of each parameter
                that the method accepts. Parameters are optional and a method can have zero or more parameters.
                The value passed for that method when the method is invoked is call ARGUMENT.

Method Body: The method body contains the statements that are executed when the method is called.
             It can include any valid Java code, such as variable declarations, control statements,
             and method calls.

when to create a method ?
    when ever we are repeating more than three lines of code at least twice you can go for a method.
