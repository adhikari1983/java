MethodOverloading:
    is a feature that ->
    allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name, but different signatures.

How to have different signatures?
    1) By changing the number of parameters that a method takes
    2) By changing the dataTypes of the parameters.
    3) By changing the sequence of parameters.

    So,The Java compiler determines which method to call based on
    the number, type, and order of the arguments passed to it.

Why should we Overload?
    1) Cleanliness
    2) Increases the readability of the program.
    3) We don't have to memorize a lot of method
       names if we are performing the same operation.
