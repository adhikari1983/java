An exception in Java is an event that occurs during the execution of a
program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs
within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime
system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the
error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred.
Types of errors:
Compile Time Errors:
    A compile-time error, or a syntax error, occurs when you write code
    that the compiler can't understand or is invalid. This type of error is
    usually detected by the compiler before the code is executed, so the code
    will not run until the errors are fixed.
Solution:
    We can fix these type of issues by learning the syntax of the language.
    Intellij can also help us fix these types of issues.
Logical issues/logical bugs:
    logical issues are when the code runs without errors, but doesn't give
    you the expected result. It means there is a problem with the underlying
    logic of the code
Solution:
    Debugger
