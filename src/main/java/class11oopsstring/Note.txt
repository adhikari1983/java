what are 2D arrays:
    2D arrays are collection of 1D arrays. That we can use to store the data in the form
    of rows and columns just like we have in excel files in the form of tables
    on webpages.
Syntax:
    Approach 1:
    data types [][] variableName= new data types[size of rows][size of columns];
    Approach 2:
    data types [][] variableName={{ element 1,element 2,element 3},
                                    {element 4,element 5,element 6}
                                    };

Object oriented programming:
    Object oriented programming also known as OOPs is nothing but some set of rules
    that if we follow, we will have below benefits. There five main concepts that we
    will be learning
     1)classes and objects
     2) inheritance
     3) polymorphism
     4) abstraction
     5) Encapsulation

from => slide
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
It simplifies the software development and maintenance

chatGpt =>
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that is used to write software using objects
that interact with each other.

layman =>
OOPs, ( is a programming paradigm) -> is a way of writing software that involves using objects that interact
with each other to perform tasks.
Imagine a car - it's made up of different parts that work together to make it move. OOPs is similar to this
idea - you have different objects that work together to perform tasks in a software program.


Benefits of OOPs
    1) code will be organized
    2) Code repetition will be minimized.
    3) changing the code will become easier.
    4) It will become easier to write code by multiple team members.
    5) security of your application will increase.
    6) writing code for larger applications will become easy.
    7) it will help represent the world around us easily.
