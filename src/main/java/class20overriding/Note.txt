Method overloading:
    1) Can we overload private methods?
    -> Yes
    2) Can we Overload the static methods?
    -> Yes
    3) Can we overload the main method?
    -> Yes
    4) Can we overload a method by changing its return type?
    -> No
===============================================================

Method Overriding:
    it's when a sub-class has the exact same method as parent method but a different
    implementation.
What are the benefits of Method Overriding.
    1) Flexibility (if you don't like something from the parent class you can override it).
    2) Cleaner code
Rules:
    1) If we want to override a method in the child class return type,method name
       and parameters they must be same.
    2) Private methods can't be overridden.
    3) We can't override constructors.
    4) Static methods
