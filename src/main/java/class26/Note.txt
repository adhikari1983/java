There are three types of maps:
          1)HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3)TreeMap

HashMap :
      The Best overall performance, but it does not maintain the insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
      It maintains the insertion order. CD little slow  then the HashMap.

TreeMap:
     It sorts the data based on keys. It is slower than HashMap & LinkedHashMap.
